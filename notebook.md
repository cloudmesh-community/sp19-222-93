### Tuesday 
* In class today, we discussed how the K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm works and worked through an example about cars.
* We applied the algorithm by hand to the data of 10 cars that we compared to a car we wanted to purchase to see if it is "fast".
* We also talked about the importance of normalization and standarization of data when using different machine learning algorithms. This is important because in our car example, speed was the dominate piece of data and resulted in other data becoming less influential when determining nearest neighbor.
