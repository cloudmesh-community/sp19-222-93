### Tuesday 2/12/19
* Organized and setup gitghub to organize what we do in class aswell as what we do for our REST project
* Completed the project proposal for the REST project

### Thursday 2/14/19
*
*

### Tuesday 3/19/19
* In class today, we discussed how the K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm works and worked through an example about cars.
* We applied the algorithm by hand to the data of 10 cars that we compared to a car we wanted to purchase to see if it is "fast".
* We also talked about the importance of normalization and standarization of data when using different machine learning algorithms. This is important because in our car example, speed was the dominate piece of data and resulted in other data becoming less influential when determining nearest neighbor.

### Thursday 3/21/19
* Completed our discussion and in class example of K-Nearest Neighbors. The started learning about logistic regression.
* We each picked a machine learning algorithm to research before so we could share it with the class.


### Tuesday 3/26/19
* Discussed packaging of python files and its importance for robustness when being run on different machines

### Thursday 3/28/19
* Talked about Docker and the process of building a Docker file to be used.

### Tuesday 4/2/19

### Thurday 4/4/19
* Went through a K-Means Clustering example involving t-shirts when using different k-values.
* Also discussed how visualizing clustered data can show very obvious problems that are not apperent from the data alone.

### Tuesday 4/9/19
* Discussed general optimization problems.
* Talked about optmization methods including gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and newtons method.

### Thurday 4/11/19

### Tuesday 4/16/19
* Went over what the structure of our final project would be.
* We need to make Dockerfile and Makefile.
* Worked on final project.

### Thurday 4/18/19
* Worked on final project code and report.
